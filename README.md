# Linkfire-Web-Traffic-Analysis
Analysis of Linkfire web traffic data, focusing on CTR, user behavior, and traffic trends using Tableau and SQL.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze website traffic, focusing on events distribution and strategies to improve click-through rates (CTR). It examines three levels of user engagement:
1. Pageview - Basic level of engagement, where a user views the page.
2. Preview - Mid-level interaction, where a user engages with content on the page.
3. Click - Actionable interaction, where a user follows a link to an external platform.
   
By analyzing these events, we gain insights into user behavior across the interaction funnel, from initial curiosity to engagement and conversion.
