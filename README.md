# Linkfire Web Traffic Analysis
Analysis of Linkfire web traffic data over the course of one week, focusing on CTR, user behavior, and traffic trends using Tableau and SQL.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze website traffic over the course of one week, focusing on events distribution and strategies to improve click-through rates (CTR). It examines three levels of user engagement:
1. Pageview - Basic level of engagement, where a user views the page.
2. Preview - Mid-level interaction, where a user engages with content on the page.
3. Click - Actionable interaction, where a user follows a link to an external platform.
   
By analyzing these events, we gain insights into user behavior across the interaction funnel, from initial curiosity to engagement and conversion.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle:
- [Website Traffic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshalpanchal/website-traffic)

## Tools
- DBeaver: Database management
- SQLite: Data manipulation
- Tableau: Data visualization
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Project organization

## Data Cleaning/Prepration
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Checking for typos.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:
- Total Events
   - How many total pageview/click/preview events were recorded for all links during the full period?
   - What was the average number of pageviews/click/preview events per day?

- Pageview Sources
   - Which countries generated the recorded pageviews?

- Click-Through Rate (CTR)
   - What was the overall CTR?

- CTR Distribution
  - How is the CTR distributed across different links?

- Correlation Between Clicks and Previews
   - Is there a correlation between clicks and previews?
   - Is the correlation statistically significant?
   - What is the effect size of the correlation?
